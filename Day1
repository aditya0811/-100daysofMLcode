# Conversion of XLSX to CSV
Besides CSV (comma delimited), a few other csv formats are available are:

<ul>
<li>CSV (comma delimited). This format saves an Excel file as a comma-separated text that can be used in another Windows program or another version of Windows operating system.
<li>CSV (Macintosh). This format saves your Excel workbook as a comma-separated file for use on Mac operating system.
<li>CSV (MS-DOS). Saves your Excel file as a comma-separated file for use on the MS-DOS operating system.
Unicode Text (*txt). This is a computing industry standard supported by almost all current operating systems including Windows, Macintosh, Linux and Solaris Unix. It can handle characters of almost all modern languages and even some ancient ones. So, if you Excel file contains data in a foreign language, save it in the Unicode Text format first and then convert to CSV.
</ul>
