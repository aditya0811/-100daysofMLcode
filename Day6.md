## Anscombes Data

Anscombeâ€™s quartet comprises four datasets that have nearly identical simple statistical properties, yet appear very different when graphed. Each dataset consists of eleven (x,y) points. They were constructed in 1973 by the statistician Francis Anscombe to demonstrate both the importance of graphing data before analyzing it and the effect of outliers on statistical properties.

## Ordinal Data
A well-known example of ordinal data is the Likert scale. An example of a Likert scale is:[3]:685

<ul>
<ls>Like-1	</ls>
<ls>Like Somewhat-2</ls>
<ls>Neutral	Dislike-3</ls>
<ls>Somewhat-4</ls>
<ls>Dislike-5</ls>
</ul>
